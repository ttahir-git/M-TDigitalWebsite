                    We are a small team of resident doctors passionate about creating free-to-use iOS applications. Our first app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/lumiere/id6503999291">PsychRef</a>, was initially developed for personal use but has since expanded to several hundred active users in the field of psychiatry. Our second app, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/psychref/id6476989971">Lumiere</a>, continues this tradition. Of particular interest to us is the intersection of mental health and artificial intelligence, a field in which we are actively engaged in research. As such, you will notice that our applications are often directly or indirectly related to these areas. We hope you derive utility and enjoyment from using our apps, and we welcome any feedback you may have to improve the user experience. All of our applications will always remain free to use.
